# 🌍 Event Horizon Platform

A hackathon project built with **React JS** and **Vite** that allows users to discover local events through an interactive map interface.

---

## 🧭 Overview

Have you ever found out about an event in your city *after* it already happened? Many people rely on social media groups or word of mouth to learn about local events, but these channels are often unreliable or fragmented. This project was created to solve that problem.

The **Event Horizon Platform** aims to make it easier for users to find nearby events and for businesses or organizations to share their upcoming activities — all in one centralized, map-based interface.

## 🚀 Features

* 🗺️ **Interactive Map View:** Displays local events using **Leaflet** and **OpenStreetMap**.
* 📋 **List View:** Toggle between map and list views to browse events more efficiently.
* 💬 **AI Chat Integration:** Uses **Gemini AI** to discuss listed events and suggest related ones.
* 🔍 **Keyword Search (Prototype):** Concept design for filtering events by keywords or categories.
* ⚙️ **React + Vite Setup:** Fast and modular front-end development workflow.

> **Note:** This project is currently front-end only. Due to time constraints during the hackathon, event data is hard-coded. Future iterations could include a backend with real-time data, authentication, and business dashboards.
